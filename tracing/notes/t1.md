The given code initializes an array of structures named `myArray` of size 5. The `myStruct` structure contains two integer variables `a` and `b`. The pointer `p` is used to point to the first element of `myArray`.

In the first loop, each element of the array is accessed using pointer arithmetic and values are assigned to `a` and `b` variables of each `myStruct` structure.

In the second loop, the values of each element of the `myArray` are printed using the `printf` function.

The output will be:

``` Expected output.
0 0 0
1 1 2
2 2 4
3 3 6
4 4 8
```

In the first column, we have the values of variable `c` starting from 0 to 4, which are printed using `%d` format specifier. In the second column, we have the values of variable `a` of each `myStruct` structure, which were initialized to `c` in the first loop. In the third column, we have the values of variable `b` of each `myStruct` structure, which were initialized to `c * 2` in the first loop.
